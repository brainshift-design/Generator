Licensing:


    A license is monthly or yearly, and includes the user ID, tier and end date.

    When a user pays, a key is issued. A license is renewed upon payment, at which point
    the current key automatically gets replaced by a new one.

    Upon payment user info is stored in a database along with a key. On renewal the new 
    key is added, this wan each user's key history is kept.

    Validation consists of a local check and a server check.
